# Contributing to BandBook

## Contributing for non-developers

There are lots of ways to contribute to BandBook - even if you're not a developer! If you have a GitHub account, you can open an issue in the repository. Otherwise, you can submit feedback directly through the application. Here are a few ideas for how you can contribute:

- **Report a bug**: If you find a bug in the application, report it! Be sure to include as much detail as possible about the bug, including what browser and device you are on, and steps to reproduce the issue.
- **Request a feature**: Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? We want to hear it! Do include as much detail as you can about the feature, including why you think it would be useful and how it could work.
- **Suggest a design change**: If you have ideas to improve the application aesthetics (how it looks/feels/etc.), let us know! At this point, any and all ideas are welcome; describing a suggested change is okay ("there should be more space between song links" or "the notification pop up stays for too long before exiting the screen") but, if you can include mockups, sketches, or design inspiration links, that's ideal.


## Contributing to the codebase

Suggested changes to the codebase are welcome, too! If you're new to contributing to open source projects, you might want to check out the [GitHub guide to contributing to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/). If you've got an idea for a new feature or a bug fix, either open an issue or just do the work and submit a pull request. If you need help finding a place to start, check out the Issues and Projects tabs of this GitHub repository. When you're ready to submit a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

### Getting started

To get up this application up and running for local development, follow the instructions in the [README](README.md).

### Style guidelines

In the future, this project will utilize ESLint and Prettier to enforce code style. For now, please model your code after the existing codebase and follow these conventions:

- Indentation for all files should be set to 2-space tabs
- Case for classes are PascalCase, functions/variables are camelCase, and css classes are kebab-case
- Use modern, non-deprecated web tech/standards (HTML5, CSS3, ES6+) targeting the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Use JSDoc comments for all functions and classes
- Be as strict as possible (`const` and `let` instead of `var`, `===` instead of `==`, etc.)

### Pull requests

Pull requests should be submitted to the `main` branch. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request, following the template provided.

### Tests

There are no tests yet. Adding some would be a great place to start contributing!
